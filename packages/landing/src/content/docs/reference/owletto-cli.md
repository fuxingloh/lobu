description: What the owletto CLI does, how it authenticates, and how to use it to run Owletto memory tools directly.
---

The `owletto` CLI starts local Owletto servers, connects agent clients, and runs memory tools directly.

## Install And Run

```bash
# Run without installing
npx owletto@latest <command>

# Or install globally
npm install -g owletto
owletto <command>
```

The published package name is `owletto`.

## Architecture Overview

Owletto is a layered memory system that separates raw capture from structured knowledge:

```
external source
  -> connectors (sync/execute)
  -> normalized events (append-only log)
  -> watcher analysis windows
  -> entities / relationships / classifications
  -> agent recall (search_knowledge, read_knowledge)
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Events** are append-only and immutable. They provide replayability, provenance, and auditability.
- **Watchers** analyze event windows and extract structured facts linked to source evidence.
- **Entities** form a hierarchical knowledge graph that turns raw capture into durable domain knowledge.
- **Actions** are first-class events too, with approval workflows for destructive operations.

## Connector SDK

Owletto's data integration layer. Each connector declares:

- `ConnectorDefinition` — auth, feeds, actions, schemas
- `ConnectorRuntime` — implements `sync()` and optional `execute()`

## Core Commands

### `owletto start`

Starts a local Owletto runtime.

```bash
npx owletto@latest start
npx owletto@latest start --port 8787
```

Default behavior:

- listens on `http://localhost:8787`
- uses embedded Postgres (`PGlite`) by default
- stores local data in `~/.owletto/data/` for packaged installs
- uses `./data/` when running from a real Owletto repo checkout

If `DATABASE_URL` is set, the CLI starts the server against external Postgres instead.

### `owletto init`

Configures local agent clients to use an Owletto MCP endpoint.

```bash
npx owletto@latest init
npx owletto@latest init --url http://localhost:8787/mcp
```

Detects supported clients and auto-configures them. Falls back to manual steps when needed.

## Authentication

### `owletto login`

Authenticates the CLI against an Owletto MCP server using OAuth.

```bash
npx owletto@latest login https://owletto.com/mcp
```

By default, the CLI opens a browser and completes an authorization-code flow with a local callback server.

Useful flags:

- `--device` uses device-code login for headless environments or browserless agents
- `--noOpen` prints the login URL instead of opening a browser
- `--scope` overrides the requested OAuth scopes

Example for a headless box:

```bash
npx owletto@latest login https://owletto.com/mcp --device
```

### `owletto token`

Prints a usable access token from the saved session.

```bash
npx owletto@latest token
npx owletto@latest token --raw
```

This is mainly useful for integrations or plugin setups that need a token command.

### `owletto health`

Checks that the saved session is valid and that the CLI can reach the MCP endpoint.

```bash
npx owletto@latest health
```

## Organization Selection

Owletto sessions are organization-aware. After login, set the default org if needed:

```bash
npx owletto@latest org current
npx owletto@latest org set my-org
```

You can also override organization and server selection per command:

- `--org <slug>`
- `--url <mcp-url>`
- `OWLETTO_ORG`
- `OWLETTO_URL`

## Run MCP Tools Directly

### `owletto run`

Lists tools when called without arguments, or executes a tool when given a tool name and JSON params.

```bash
# List available tools
npx owletto@latest run

# Search memory
npx owletto@latest run search_knowledge '{"query":"Acme"}'

# Read saved content
npx owletto@latest run read_knowledge '{"query":"customer preferences"}'

# Save new knowledge
npx owletto@latest run save_knowledge '{"content":"Prefers weekly summaries","semantic_type":"preference","metadata":{}}'
```

This is the most direct way to inspect or test Owletto memory behavior outside an agent runtime.

### Which MCP tools are available?

The exact tool list depends on the endpoint and your session scope. Run `owletto run` with no arguments to see what's available.

**Core memory:** `search_knowledge`, `read_knowledge`, `save_knowledge`

**Watchers:** `list_watchers`, `get_watcher`

**Organization:** `list_organizations`, `switch_organization` (unscoped endpoint only)

**Admin / workspace** (admin sessions only): `manage_entity`, `manage_entity_schema`, `manage_connections`, `manage_feeds`, `manage_auth_profiles`, `manage_operations`, `manage_watchers`, `manage_classifiers`, `query_sql`

## Other Useful Commands

### `owletto doctor`

Checks local prerequisites such as Node, Docker, and current server reachability.

```bash
npx owletto@latest doctor
```

### `owletto browser-auth`

Captures browser-based auth/cookie state for connectors that rely on a real browser session.

This is mainly for connector setup, not day-to-day memory usage.

### `owletto configure`

Writes OpenClaw plugin config for `@lobu/owletto-openclaw` using an `owletto token` command.

## Repo-Local Development

When working inside the Owletto repository itself, you can run the TypeScript entrypoint directly:

```bash
pnpm -C packages/cli exec tsx src/bin.ts start
pnpm -C packages/cli exec tsx src/bin.ts init
pnpm -C packages/cli exec tsx src/bin.ts run search_knowledge '{"query":"spotify"}'
```

## How This Fits With Lobu

Use the Lobu CLI to scaffold and run Lobu projects. Use the Owletto CLI when you need to stand up or inspect the memory system behind Lobu.
